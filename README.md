## `crowdsrc-discourse-relations`

### Repository for the tools and data for my MA thesis `Annotating multimodal discourse relations by combining crowdsourcing and natural language processing`.

Majority of the functionality is adapted from an old version of https://github.com/thiippal/abulafia with some additions. Some functionality in this repo depends on the outdated version as well as an older version of `toloka-kit`.

All the different Trial runs in Experiment 3 used the same configuration files in either `pipeline_3_small/` for the small sample sizes or `pipeline_3_large/` for the larger sample sizes. The settings in the configuration files are from the latest trial runs. The used settings for each trial run can be found in the thesis.

Any files containing information about crowdworkers (such as worker IDs) are removed.
